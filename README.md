This is a programing language I'm building myself for studing purposes
while I study about compilers. There's no estimated date for release.

You can find the most stable version in the `development` branch.
Though, it's not gonna be usable yet.

You can find the syntax in [`docs/syntax-specs.md`](docs/syntax-specs.md),
though it's under development too. Some parts will be removed later on.
